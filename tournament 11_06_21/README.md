This was my first BJJ tournament in 9 years, last time I competed I wa in Okinawa, got 2nd place. I competed in Gi and No Gi crusiserweight 181-191lbs, I weighed in at 182lbs being the lightest person in my brackets. Ended the day 4-1 only loss came from a submission (kimura). I beat the rest of my opponets by points taking 1st ðŸ¥‡ in Gi and 3rdðŸ¥‰ in No Gi. 

Some analysis after watching the videos.

1. Need to work on passing the guard and attacking from the top position.

2. Need to work on my submission transitions. I had a few arm bar, omoplata, and triangle attempts that I didnâ€™t finish.

3. Learn Gi takedown throws.

4. Work on shooting. I had a lot of good upper body throws but missed a lot of opportunities for shots.
